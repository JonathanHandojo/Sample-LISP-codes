# Sample-LISP-codes
This short snippet dictates how you can load .lsp files into AutoCAD for use.

In order to load the attached files into AutoCAD, you can do one of two things:

1.	Simply drag and drop the attached .lsp files into an active AutoCAD drawing, and you will be able to start using the commands, or;
2.	Initiate the APPLOAD command, and load the .lsp files from there (recommended)

You may be prompted with a dialog of whether you’d like to load this LISP file. If this does show up, click on “Load Once” (or you can click “Always Load” so that the same dialog doesn’t show up the next time you load this program).

They may be .lsp files, but you can open them using notepad to view the step-by-step instructions that I’ve included in the .lsp files. Feel free to have a read there too. 

Download the files by clicking on the green "Code" button below and choosing "Download ZIP". Feel free to have a try of these codes for yourself.
